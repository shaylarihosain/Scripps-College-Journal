• InDesign exporter's fully functional — package away!
• That's right: drag your InDesign file onto the SCJ Dock icon to email your layout work to the senior designer, or package the magazine to our print house’s specification
• Introducing announcements: delivers staff news
• You can get right back to work later, without restarting the app. And now it intelligently decides, noting if you've got the issue open, and what you chose to work on, whether to display Tips or offer the design guides again if you're returning after a while
• Smart installer helps new users avoid installing the app twice
• Clearer wording better differentiates a new design guide from a software update
• Enhanced experience if you haven't given the app proper access
• Improvements when alerting you if your storage is too full
• Adds compatibility with macOS Monterey

Fixed bugs:
• “Press ⌘Q to quit” notification works better

Note: if you have a version older than 0.8.1, except for 0.7.1, you will need to manually reinstall from our website to update. We're sorry.

NEW IN 1.1:
• Native support for Macs with Apple M chips. Speed improvements on models: MacBook Air (Late 2020), MacBook Pro (Late 2020 or later), Mac mini (Late 2020), iMac (Early 2021)
• Official multi-user support
• Your settings & usage history now persist through app updates; independently for each user account
• With Tips Actions, open Artwork folder in Finder, or tracker in browser
• Consistent, rich notifications experience that suits macOS Monterey
• Privacy improvements: no longer retains info about system after quitting (like last user, or macOS version). No longer reads hardware identifier
• New features are highlighted after installing a software update
• App size reduced by over half (~4 MB to ~1.5 MB)
• Senior designer features enabled (log in to uninstall, reset settings, or disable Adobe version checks)
		
NEW IN 1.0:
• Drag a Word doc onto SCJ Dock icon to place that story on your page. Picks text box, formats text in SCJ style, and reflows story through pages — it's automatic
• Finds & suggests old SCJ design guides on your computer if you don’t have the newest
• Improvements to magazine exporter, including sounds when jobs finish, a cancel job option, and clearer options after
• Welcome message on first run when design guides are successfully installed
• App intelligently knows when the cover illustration is open also, not just the magazine design
• Clearer wording when design guides are updated over existing guides
• Explanation when app requests access to Documents & Downloads folders
• More reliable on unstable Internet connections
• Various optimizations and improved security

FIXED BUGS IN 1.1:
• If you delete Artwork folder, new one is auto-created instead of crashing
• Crash if InDesign and Illustrator versions are from different years
• On MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, touchscreen icons could be misshapen on macOS Big Sur or later
• On macOS Big Sur or later, when offered older design guides, titles could be truncated
• When magazine is delayed, issue year didn’t match volume number
• One-time security warning from Apple is worded more positively for new users

FIXED BUGS IN 1.0:
• Reliability improvements when placing visual art
• On subsequent runs, SCJ InDesign workspace wouldn’t always be reapplied
• Running the app in different user account on the same computer would crash
• Exports all pages even if InDesign had less chosen. Won’t export without PDF presets installed
• Locating old design guide manually, and then updating it wouldn’t use the updated one until next time
• Rare: if app is run on one computer, then transferred to another, displayed options wouldn’t work

Note: if you have version 0.7.1 or older, you will need to manually reinstall from our website to update. We're sorry.

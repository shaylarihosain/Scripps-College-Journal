• Some users don't quit when done, so now you can get right back to work without quitting
• Check for updates without restarting the app
• Minor speed improvements

Fixed bugs:
• Updating guides without replacing resulted in endless loop under certain conditions
• If you move the guides, you were prompted to relocate them twice rather than once
• SCJ quick auto-updater would not update all parts of the app on macOS Big Sur
